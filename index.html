<span style="font-family: trebuchet ms;">Stags second home game of the
season started off at a hectic pace, as the Jazz tried to fast break on
every possession. After the 1st quarter though the stags had built a
healthy 26-19 lead while playing the Jazz at their own game. A flurry
of 3's from the Jazz was met by more fast break points and dominating
scoring inside from Babb. Halftime Stags were up 55-45. The third
quarter was a tight affair, with the Jazz scoring mostly from the
outside, and Stags continuining to match their younger opponents, 22-22
in the third. <br>
<br>
With a 10 point lead going into the 4th all the Stags had to do was to
take care of the ball and work the offense. However a pressing defense
from the Jazz which forced a number of turnovers in the final few
minutes and 5 three pointers to finish the game, led the Jazz to a 1
point lead with 9 seconds left. Stags got the ball up-court but a shot
with only a couple of seconds left rimmed out to leave the stags
fouling and the Jazz on the line with 1 second to go. One foul shot
made and the game was over, a great shooting display but a crushing
defeat.<br>

<span style="font-family: trebuchet ms;">Stags
2nd game of 2006 proved to be an up and down victory. Pulling away to a
comfortable lead in the 1st half, missed free throws, turnovers and a
couple of quick 3's from the opposition shooting guard all led to a
single digit lead in the 3rd quarter. But not to be denied the stags
fed the ball inside to score with ease down low, with Glover and Babb
doing most of the damage in this quarter. Despite continued misses from
the line (a total of 19 were missed in the game!!) the Stags managed to
pull out a near 20 point lead to coast to victory in the last few
minutes.<br>
<br>
Special mention must go to the travelling supporters group who turned out loudly and in force to cheer us on!<br>

   <!-- ParagraphBodyStart --><font style="color: oldlace;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">28.11.05<br>
<span style="font-family: trebuchet ms;">Stags
made their home debut at islington Green school for the 05-06 season,
and had the mighty challenge of playing Lithuanian BB in the cup, a
team a full two divisions above! However, an immediate setback in the
warm up as newly signed utility man Chris Glover attempted a monster
jam and jumped so high he forgot how to come down, landing awkwardly on
his ankle. Then there were seven. But with Larry Jazz and 'the Bone'
manning the table there was plenty of support for the remaining Stags.
And as the game started, it was clear the team were not intimmidated
by the Premier Division team, scoring freely on the break, and keeping
the Lithuanian lead within single digits. A couple of dagger 3's from
the Eastern European sharp shooters extended their lead to 11 after the
first quarter. In the second quarter the Stags struggled to score as they
forced the Lithuanians into a re-think, but their switch to a zone
caught the run &amp; gun Stags off guard, and the lead at half time was
44-24.<br>
<br>
In the second half though Stags came out fighting , scoring 19 in the
3rd quarter and 25 in the 4th, winning both quarters and clearly
frustrating and confusing the opposition with their hussle and Northern
trash-talk. Only two 3 pointers were conceded in the second half, a
measure of the improvement in the Stags perimeter defense. A tough
physical game, and a lot learnt from quality opposition, taking a
perfomance like this into the remaining Div 2 fixtures can only bring
positive results.<br>

<span style="font-family: trebuchet ms;">Another
lazy sunday lunchtime, and Stags made their way to South Bank uni, to
play the youthful 2nd team of Omega, in this potentially top of the
table clash. With a bench full of players and youth on their side,
Omega looked to run and gun early, as they quickly built an 8 point
lead. The Stags re-grouped and switched to their well-homed 3-2
defense; this frustrated the younger opposition and a series of fast
breaks from Marchesi, Parks and newcomer Glover resulted in Stags
taking the first quarter 24-18. In the second quarter Stags totally
outplayed Omega, again taking it strong to the hoop and getting the
opposition into early foul trouble, and by half time had a very healthy
47-32 lead.<br>
<br>
The second half was much of the same, with Stags defense giving up
points rarely and Omega not able to stop the Stags relentless fast
break. 3rd and 4th quarters were also won - at one point Stags were up
30 - for an overall victory of 83-64. Another solid win for the Stags,
a welcome return to form from Manchesado and an excellent debut from
Glover manning the point for most of the game.<br>

<span style="font-family: trebuchet ms;">With
more players available and a lovely new gym, Stags were looking forward
to playing fellow division contenders and old divional rivals
Christians in Action. This showed from the start as the Stags built a
healthy 10-point cushion early on with slick passing and knocking down
the open jump shots given by the opponents zone defense. The 2nd
quarter saw the CIA pull back the lead but some more patient offense
and solid 'd' saw the Stags stretch the lead out to 8 at half-time. A
lead which should perhaps have been more but a lead none the less.<br>
<br>
The second half was a different story as the Stags lost their way due
to a harrassing full court press and a tighter man defense from CIA.
Turnovers and bad decisions led to a couple of well needed time outs
before the Stags re-grouped and again got to a double digit lead.
Unfortunately the final quarter saw a pressing box and 1 defense by the
opposition limit the Stags to just 7 4th quarter points and it was CIA
who ran away with the victory in the closing stages. Lessons were
learnt and will be worked on in training for Stags to take their
revenge next time out.<br>

<span style="font-family: trebuchet ms;">Stags
showed up in Hendon not sure if there was a game or not, but soon found
the NW JAzz team warming up so it looked like game on. One problem,
they failed to organise refs for the game. Luckily some senior
Middlesex players agreed to ref the game and after the longest 5 man
warm up in history the Stags 'Super 5' took to the floor. Not wanting
to waste valuable 4th quarter energy the Stags got off to a slow start,
and once it was figured out that only one Jazz player was going to
score </span></font><span class="style1"><font size="2">(</font></span><font style="color: oldlace;" size="2"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms;">and purely on 3's) </span></font><font style="color: oldlace;" size="2"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms;">hey
soon started to claw back the lead. By halftime the lead was just 6,
and the Stags had hardly broken a sweat, clearly using their veteran
smarts to save themselves for later in the game.<br>
<br>
By the end of the third quarter the lead was down to 1 point, and this
only due to a couple of 3 point 'prayers' offered up by the young Jazz
team. Having shut down their one scoring threat with the use of a tight
3-2 zone, it was in the 4th quarter that the Stags made their mark with
a flurry of drives to the hoop to open up a healthy 7 point lead
entering the final 2 minutes.despite a couple of late Jazz baskets Dean
'Machine' Pinnock put the icing on the cake in the final minute with a
trademark pull-up to seal the win.<br>
<br>
All in all a good away victory with just 5 players (average age 120) to their 12+2 (average age 16). <br>

<span style="font-family: trebuchet ms;">City Stags won a
tough away fixture to start their 05/06 London Met campaign, the 7th in
the clubs history. After surviving an initial burst of 3's from an
athletic Westside and having only 5 players in the first half (and no
kit thanks to a malfunctioning flux capacitor) the Stags began
assaulting Westside's hoop, drawing fouls and getting them into early
foul trouble. The resulting free throws pulled the Stags level until
they took the lead just before half time with a steadily improving
offense.</span><br style="font-family: trebuchet ms;">
<br style="font-family: trebuchet ms;">
<span style="font-family: trebuchet ms;">
In the second half Stags upped the defenssive intensity (Westide only
scored 14 points in the second half in total) and with a time lord back
from the future, were able to pull away for a comfortable 17 point
victory. And all this without any training...the future possibilities
are endless!! </span><br>
